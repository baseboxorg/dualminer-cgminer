Dualminer-cgminer is ASIC  miner for both SHA-256 and Scrypt ,it is cgminer-3.5.0-based development,had a large number of test on Raspberry pi and beagleboard.
Certainly, on windows and linux such as ubuntu,it also run well.

You can dualminer support websit(http://support.dualminer.com/) to know how to make your dm3/dm2/dm1 work effcicently use Dualminer-cgminer.
Or
 The flowing sections will tell you how to make the Dualminer-cgminer and run it. 


The first verison of dualminer-cgminer ,is under debugging, so there maybe some errors and bugs. And they will be fixed in the near future. If you encounter an error ,you can submit to us through email(dualminer@broadeng.net)
your comments and suggestions are welcome.

You can miner litecoin or bitcoin by DualMiner USB.

The DualMiner USB is the world's first ASIC based USB miner for both SHA-256 and Scrypt.It can be setup to mine Litecoin only, or Bitcoin and Litecoin simultaneously.
Paying more attention to http://www.dualminer.com ,  new miner will be upcoming ,higher hash force use less power.

The following will show how to compile the dualminer-cgminer.
For more details,see README.cgminer.

----------------------------------------
Install

compiling for linux(ubuntu10 version or higher)
./configure --enable-dualminer --enable-scrypt --disable-opencl  --prefix=$DIR_PATH/
make && make install 
may be you need to use sudo for more permissions.


Cross compiling for Windows


dualminer-cgminer can be build on a linux or the win32 platform,using the mingw cross compiler collection.
On a ubuntu based system this should work,may be  need to change the install dir where you wish to place.


install mingw32. 
sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
install libpthreads-mingw-w64
sudo apt-get install libpthreads-mingw-w64
or
wget http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/pthreads-win32/libpthreads-mingw-w64_2.9.1+dfsg-1_all.deb
                sudo dpkg -i libpthreads-mingw-w64_2.9.1+dfsg-1_all.deb
                rm -rf libptheads-mingw-w64_2.9.1+dfsg-1_all.deb

install  curl
sudo wget http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.34.0.tar.gz
        sudo tar zxf curl-7.34.0.tar.gz
        cd curl-7.34.0
